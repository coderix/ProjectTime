# ProjectTime
This is a simple IOS time tracking program. I developed it for my personal use. The app will not get a design award, but it is operational for me. This is my first Swift project and many things can certainly be improved.

For time recording customers, projects and tasks must be defined. Only then you can record project hours via the "Projects" tab.

# Installation

After cloning, you must customize the projectTime.xcodeproj project file. Go to Signing&Capabilities and add a team account.

If necessary, you can activate iCloud:
Go to capabilities, add iCloud, then select Cloudkit for Services and create a container. (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit).
